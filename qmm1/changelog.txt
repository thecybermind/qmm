CHANGE LOG
Version: 1.1.3 (03/04/06)
	- Added plugin version to "qmm list" output, requested by im2good4u
	- Fixed crash bug related to GAME_CLIENT_CONNECT return value pointer, it is now modified for QVMs as necesary

Version: 1.1.2 (02/21/06)
	- Fixed a bug related to NoCrash output, user that is performing the exploit is no longer shown

Version: 1.1.1 (01/30/06)
	- Fixed compile error in source download
	- Removed temporary debugging code that I left in CVMMod::vmMain that caused crashes under certain circumstances
	
Version: 1.1.0 (01/29/06)
	- Added another sanity check when loading a QVM
	- Added greeting for newly-connecting clients
	- Added global "nogreeting" option (integer type) to qmm.ini to disable the greeting
	- Added NoCrash functionality directly into QMM
	- Added NoCrash block for long commands (can overflow buffers while in QVM mode)
	- Added qmm_nocrash cvar to enable/disable NoCrash functionality (default is enabled, "1")
	- Big thanks to =FF= Clan ( http://www.ffclan.net/ ) for the original NoCrash plugin idea!
	- Added "source" column in "qmm list" output, shows where plugin was loaded from, can either be "cmd" or "conf"
	- Fixed "Paused" column in "qmm list" output
	- Changed applicable cvars to use CVAR_ARCHIVE flag instead of CVAR_NORESTART
	- Changed default qmmexec path to qmmaddons/qmm/qmmexec.cfg
	- Changed failure method if unable to determine game engine, now uses G_ERROR assuming value of 1
	- Changed plugin API version to 1:0
	- Removed the ability to set read-only cvars qmm_version and qmm_game
	- Removed support for QMM-provided malloc/free functions for QVM mods
	- Removed QVM callback support, will be improved in future versions
	- Removed support for qmm.cfg and qmm.conf, only qmm.ini is supported

Version: 1.0.0 (10/13/05)
	- Added 'qmm shutdown' command to unload all unneccesary functions
		* Sets qmm_shutdown cvar just before entering shutdown mode
		* QMM just routes syscall and vmMain calls
		* Checks qmm_shutdown cvar on load, does minimal load if set
		
	- Added more mod information to 'qmm status'
	- Added set of helper functions passed to plugins on load
	- Added plugin interface versioning system
	- Added detection of linux user home directories, i.e. ~/.q3a/
	- Added support for GCC's address-of-label operator to speed up
	  QVM opcode execution
	- Added non-intrusive message to all clients on initial connection
	- Improved loading of mod and usage of fallbacks/defaults
	- QVM mod files no longer loaded into memory first
	- Managers are now true singletons loaded with Mgr::GetInstance()
	- Fixed errors in linux game recognition/default settings
	- Fixed errors in auto mod-file loading settings
	- Fixed bug where plugins were given wrong pointer for mod's vmMain
	  function in QMM_Attach()
	- Failed DLL loads now output dlerror() information
	
Version: 0.9.0b (?/?/05)
	- Integrated QVM support into 1 QMM build, QMMVM is deprecated
	- Integrated game support into 1 QMM build
	- Added plugin helper functions passed in QMM_Attach

	  configuration file handling

	  qmm.rc
	- Improved plugins.ini parsing

Version: 0.3.0b (8/17/04)
	- Added RtCW support
	- Added support for "Post" API plugin functions (QMM_vmMain_Post &
	  QMM_syscall_Post)
	- Added more output for startup operations
	- Added SETVMHOOK_VOID and SETVMHOOK macros in qmm.h for plugins hooking
	  non-API functions
	- Changed "result" pointer to be a static CPlugin member
	- Changed GETPTR and SETPTR macros in qmm.h to use variable g_vmbase,
	  set in plugins' vmMain_Post
	- Changed some WARNINGs to ERRORs and some ERRORs to WARNINGs and one
	  FATAL ERROR
	- Changed mod/plugin shutdown order (plugins unload first now)
	- Changed location of debug log, qmmlog.txt is now in the mod directory
